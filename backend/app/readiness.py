"""Readiness banding.

One definition, used by the admin view, the cohort dashboard and every
export, so a student is never "placement ready" on one screen and "needs
training" on another.

The bands are on the presentation scale (0–100). They are a
*platform* judgement about practice progress — never a claim about a vendor
score, and never presented as a guarantee (MOT-04, DIAG-10).
