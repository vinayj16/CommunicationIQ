"""Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (ENG-13).

Replaces the running mean the gap meter used to read. Both answer "how likely
is it that this student has this sub-skill", but BKT answers it with a model
that separates two things a mean cannot: getting it right by luck, and getting
it wrong despite knowing it.

That distinction is what stops the meter lurching. A student who has shown a
skill four times and slips once has slipped; a mean treats it as a fifth of
their ability disappearing. BKT's slip parameter absorbs it, and the posterior
barely moves — which is the honest reading, and also the one that does not
punish somebody for a bad morning.

Four parameters per skill, in the classic formulation:

* **P(L0)** — probability they already had it before we saw anything
* **P(T)**  — probability of acquiring it between opportunities
* **P(G)**  — probability of getting it right without having it (guess)
* **P(S)**  — probability of getting it wrong while having it (slip)

The defaults below are literature-typical starting values, not fitted ones.
Fitting them per skill needs far more response data than exists, and inventing
fitted-looking numbers would be worse than admitting they are priors.
