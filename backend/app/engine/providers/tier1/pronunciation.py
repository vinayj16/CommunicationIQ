"""Tier 1 — goodness of pronunciation (ENG-04).

How clearly was each word articulated, measured by forced-aligning the target
text against a wav2vec2 CTC model's own frame posteriors and reading off how
confident the acoustic model was at each aligned frame. That is the classic
GOP construction: the log-posterior of the target unit given the audio.

**It is character-level, not phoneme-level.** The model's vocabulary is 32
characters, so a word's score is the mean posterior over its aligned letters
rather than its phones. That is a real approximation and it is named as one —
a phoneme-level GOP, and with it the per-phoneme confusion pairs that DIAG-03
wants, needs a phoneme-output acoustic model and a grapheme-to-phoneme front
end. Neither is built.

**It scores intelligibility, not nativeness.** The question it answers is "how
confidently did an English recogniser hear this word here", which is close to
"would a listener catch it". It is not "how close to a native reference", and
the difference is the whole reason this product exists. An accented speaker who
articulates clearly scores well.

Distinct from word accuracy on purpose: accuracy asks whether the right words
came out at all, this asks how clearly they were said. A word can be recovered
correctly and still be mumbled, and those are different things to tell a
student.
