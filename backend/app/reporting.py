"""What the report says, beyond the numbers.

Everything here is a rearrangement of measurements the pipeline already
produced. Nothing computes a score, and nothing may: ``biggest_lever`` lives
inside ``SCORING_PATH`` and stays exactly as it is, so this module sits above
the freeze the same way ``weighting`` and ``evaluation`` do.

Four things the audit asked for and the report did not have:

**Strengths, not only weaknesses.** The result gave one "biggest lever" and
nothing else — a screen that tells a nineteen-year-old the single worst thing
about how they speak, every time, with no counterweight. Somebody who reads
that after each attempt learns that practising produces criticism. What they
are good at is measured just as precisely and was simply never shown.

**Recommendations as a set.** One lever is one instruction. Two or three,
ordered by how much each would actually move the number, is a plan — and the
gains are computed the same honest way the single lever's was: what the
overall *would be* if this dimension matched the student's own best, not a
figure chosen because it reads well.

**Evidence per dimension.** The data has been stored since M2 —
transcripts, word timings, grammar errors, pauses. "Your grammar was 54" is
an assertion; "your grammar was 54, and here are the four sentences it was
counted from" is something a student can argue with, which is the point.

**A plain summary at the top.** The Phase 0 rule. A student opening their
result should meet a sentence in their own language before a chart.
