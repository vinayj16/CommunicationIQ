/**
 *  Two environments, on purpose.
 *
 *  The library tests (`lib/*.test.ts`) run in node. They are about IndexedDB,
 *  retry budgets and arithmetic, and giving them a DOM would only slow them
 *  down and let a component creep into a file that is supposed to be testing a
 *  function.
 *
 *  Component tests need a DOM and ask for it themselves, with
 *  `// @vitest-environment jsdom` at the top of the file. Vitest 4 dropped
 *  `environmentMatchGlobs`, and the per-file docblock is the better shape
 *  anyway: a test that needs a browser says so where somebody reading it will
 *  see it, rather than in a config file two directories away.
