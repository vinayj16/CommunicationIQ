"""Admin-configurable AI narration settings.

The environment supplies defaults (app.config.Settings); a single
``platform_settings`` row keyed ``ai_narration`` overrides them, and the
platform console edits that row. Applying an override mutates the live
``settings`` object — the same object every provider reads and every test
monkeypatches — so a change takes effect without a restart in this process.
(Other worker processes pick it up on their next start; the row is the truth.)

Secrets never leave the API once stored: readers get ``{set, last4}``.
Writers send a real value to change a key, ``null`` to leave it unchanged,
and ``""`` to clear it.
