"""Scoring an attempt.

The pipeline talks to capabilities, never to implementations: every call goes
through the registry, so which provider ran — and what happened when it timed
out — is configuration. Each score it writes carries the provider id and
version that produced it (ENG-21).

**Scoring happens as each answer arrives, not in a batch at the end.** A local
speech model runs at roughly 0.6× real time on CPU, so a batch of eight items
would leave a student watching a spinner for twenty seconds. Scored on ingest,
item four is transcribed while item five is being spoken, and by the time they
press submit the work is already done. ``finalise_attempt`` then only has to
compose what is there.

What it will not do is fill gaps. A capability with no provider configured
leaves its dimension unscored and says why — a plausible number with nothing
behind it is worse than a blank, because a student would act on it.
